A toolbox for MTP.

### Inlinepositions
The reincarnation of MetroGraphs. Most of the same information, but much faster.

___
### Z Registration
Load a HeightSensorLog.txt file and click on scans to see their graphical and statistical representation.

___
### Fingerprinting
See print error in vector format.

___
### Print Cycle Simulation
Load a .xrec and .xmap to step through and visually verify the planned print.

___

This app has the greatest potential to grow as there is a ton of usable info in the log.
Open to requests!

___
### Data File Tree
A personal favorite. Decide on your variables and let the app create the file structure for you.
Just save and overwrite the generated documents and a time and brain-saving tasklist.

___
### Map Flip
Excel doesn't seem to have a native tool for flipping and rotating grids of data at will.
This will!
