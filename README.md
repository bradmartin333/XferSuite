### Inlinepositions
The reincarnation of MetroGraphs. Most of the same information, but much faster.

### XYZ Scan
Load a HeightSensorLog.txt file and click on scans to see their graphical and statistical representation.

___
### Fingerprinting
See print error in vector format.

___
### Print Cycle Simulation
Load a .xrec and .xmap to step through and visually verify the planned print.

___
### SEYR Parser
Load a SEYR report to conert raw data into yields.

A personal favorite. Decide on your variables and let the app create the file structure for you.
Just save and overwrite the generated documents and a time and brain-saving tasklist.

___
### Map Flip
Excel doesn't seem to have a native tool for flipping and rotating grids of data at will.
